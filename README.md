# Mzinga #

[![CI Build](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Mzinga is a collection of open-source software to play the abstract board game [Hive](https://gen42.com/games/hive), with the primary goal of building a community of developers who create Hive-playing AIs.

To that end, Mzinga proposes a [Universal Hive Protocol](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/wiki/UniversalHiveProtocol) to support interoperability for Hive-playing software.

For more information on Mzinga and its projects, please check out the [Mzinga Wiki](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/wiki).
